# Windows 10 HTML Replica
### Designed by Microsoft (obviously) and Replicated by Tanner Villarete

# Note
As of January 2018, a new version of this replica is being made. To view the
old version, you'll have to find the specific commit and download those files.
I promise you the new version will be miles better (hopefully!)

## Note
_This replica is very much a work in progress. Currently many core features are missing_

# Features
